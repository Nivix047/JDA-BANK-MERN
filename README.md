# JDA-BANK-MERN

## Description

JDA Bank is a full stack development project. A money transfer app that allows users to transfer money to one another.   As the world is moving to a digital and more tech savvy society, paper money is slowly becoming less and less popular.  By using this app, users can ditch passing paper money back and forth and just transfer money to one another digitally! The front end of this application was developed using REACT.  The entirety of this application was developed using the MERN stack. 

Frontend: 
Use components to render all of the different pages of the project. Other pages of the project that were not part of the components were rendered by using routes and linkes. The use of hooks is to recieve information for the forms and give user information to the backend.

Backend: 
The database was created using Mongoose. Mongoose was the main database that was used for all backend data and queried using GraphQL.
